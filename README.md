# Mythic Metals

Mythic Metals is a Fabric based Minecraft mod, that adds new ores, materials, tools and sets of armor. 
The mod is heavily inspired by Shadowclaimers Metallurgy, and was originally intended as a port.  
After being denied the privilege to do so this mod was created from the ground up as my first proper Minecraft mod.

You can find the patch notes in the PATCHNOTES.md file.
